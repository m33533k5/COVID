## This project requires the Java Compiler 11.
* Properties 
* Java Compiler 
* Compiler compliance level: 11

## What i have learned:
- Version Control
- Build Management Tool
- Object oriented programming

## What I haven't learned yet, but would like to learn in the future:
- create more Test (JUnit)
- implementing CI/CD (Jenkins)
- Database (Hibernate)
- Spring / Angular / React (unsure which one first)

## Why did I start the project?
In our studies, we were supposed to find a project for the subject of application programming. Since I spend almost every day on the page of the "Morgenpost" to look at the current case numbers, I thought that I would also like to build something like that, simplified. With this project, I wanted to expand my acquired knowledge in Java. Personally, I think that tools like version control or build management tools are standard. Because we don't get taught this in our studies, I wanted to integrate these things into my study project. In addition, I dealt with object programming and was able to implement this in my programme.

## General information:
This project shows you case numbers graphically. In different types of diagrams. In addition, you can change the language between German and English (the countries are not translated yet) and switch between Countries and States.

Here you can see a picture with German language:
