## Why did I start the project?
In our studies, we were supposed to find a project for the subject of application programming. Since I spend almost every day on the page of the "Morgenpost" to look at the current case numbers, I thought that I would also like to build something like that, simplified. With this project, I wanted to expand my acquired knowledge in Java. Personally, I think that tools like version control or build management tools are standard. Because we don't get taught this in our studies, I wanted to integrate these things into my study project. In addition, I dealt with object programming and was able to implement this in my programme. After I had handed in the project, I wanted to continue working on the topic. This is the result.

##Fundaments:
The data comes from the page via HTTP request and is stored in a JSON file and processed further. Through object programming, each country receives its own properties that are later accessed. This made it relatively easy for me to process the data in a diagram. 

## General information:
This project shows you case numbers graphically. In different types of diagrams. In addition, you can change the language between German and English (the countries are not translated yet) and switch between Countries and States.

Here you can see a picture with German language:
