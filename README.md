In our studies, we were supposed to find a project for the subject of application programming. Since I spend almost every day on the page of the "Morgenpost" to look at the current case numbers, I thought that I would also like to build something like that, simplified. 

This project shows you case numbers graphically. In different types of diagrams. In addition, you can change the language between German and English.
