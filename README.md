In our studies, we were supposed to find a project for the subject of application programming. Since I spend almost every day on the page of the "Morgenpost" to look at the current case numbers, I thought that I would also like to build something like that, simplified. With this project, I wanted to expand my acquired knowledge in Java. Personally, I think that tools like version control or build management tools are standard. For this reason, I decided to integrate them into my project. In addition, I dealt with object programming and was able to implement this in my programme.

This project shows you case numbers graphically. In different types of diagrams. In addition, you can change the language between German and English (the countries are not translated yet) and switch between Countries and States.
